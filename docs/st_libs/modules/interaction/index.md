# Interaction

Interaction module is a module to interact with your database.

## Include Interaction in your script

1. To use the Interaction library, just add the initiator as a shared script inside of your `fxmanifest.lua` file.
```lua
shared_scripts {
  '@st_libs/init.lua'
}
```
You can now use the library inside of your resource with the `st.interaction` global variable.
