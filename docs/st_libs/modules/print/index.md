# Print

Print is a module to print different types of message.

## Include Ped Texture in your script

1. Print module is included by default in the st_libs. You just have to add the initiator as a shared script inside of your `fxmanifest.lua` file.
```lua
shared_scripts {
  '@st_libs/init.lua'
}
```
You can now use the print functions inside of your resource.
