# Callback

Callback module is a module to create easy links between your client and server sides in your script.

## Include Callback in your script

1. To use the Callback library, just add the initiator as a shared script inside of your `fxmanifest.lua` file.
```lua
shared_scripts {
  '@st_libs/cache.lua'
}
```

You can now use the library inside of your resource with the `cache.ped` global variable.
