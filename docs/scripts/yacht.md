## 4. For developers

### Actions

[Actions](/DeveloperResources/actions) are the new way to modify how the script works or add new features. These actions are event that occurs at a specific point in time during the execution of the script. But contrary to events, actions are **synchronous**. 

#### <Badge type="client" text="Client" /> startYachtHeist
Fires when the yacht heist is started
```lua
exports.st_yachtheist:registerAction('startYachtHeist', function()
end)
```

### Filters

[Filters](/DeveloperResources/filters) are the new way to modify data used by the script. These filters are fired at a specific point in time during the execution of the script. But contrary to events, filters are **synchronous**. 

#### <Badge type="client" text="Client" /> canStartYachtHeist
Fires before the yacht heist is started
```lua
---@param canStart - boolean
exports.st_yachtheist:registerFilter('canStartYachtHeist', function(canStart)
	return canStart
end)
```

### Exports

#### <Badge type="client" text="Client" /> Start the yacht heist
Export to start Yacht Heist
```lua
exports['st_yachtheist']:StartHeist()
```
